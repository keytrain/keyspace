Traumatizing. I developed an extremely cynical attitude towards relationships with people of any kind. When I met you, for the the first year of knowing you, I was always prepared for the eventuality that you’d do something shitty.</p>\n<p>But you never did. And it’s because of that, that I was able to begin to heal some of that trauma from high school. I’m not sure where I’d be if I never met you, but it’s possible I may not have any of the relationships I have now, including the girl I’m about to marry.</p>\n<p>Of course, I also have so many great memories from our time in college.</p>\n<p>The long hours of discussing the randomest shit in the ERC cafeteria, to drunken smash bros, to that one time we came back from a movie and thought the road was too cinematic. Juggling seven threads of convos at once, diving deep into topics, sharing new approaches to life and trying them out together and giving feedback. Listening to Taylor Swift, freezing Nima’s boxers, cramming for biology till 5am. You blaring “Stephen”.</p>\n<p>I’ll cherish those memories forever.</p>\n<p>The combination of these things has made you into a very important person in my life, and the more time has passed, the more obvious it becomes. There’s nobody else who’d make more sense to be up there with me on my wedding day.</p>\n<p>So John, will you be one of my groomsmen?</p>\n<p>I know you’ve got a busy life, so if you can’t make it, I’ll understand. Let me know. You know how to reach me.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the gifts! We should catch up more often.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"John","date":null,"updated":null,"detached":"true"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/john/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
