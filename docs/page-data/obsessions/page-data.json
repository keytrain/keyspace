Wacom’s are cool too. It’s not the tool that matters, but I have to say the ease of picking up an iPad Mini and getting back into it is a real factor in finishing a piece sometimes.</p>\n<h1>Monitors</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Dell UW3417W</h4>\n<p>Dell generally makes good monitors (for now). It was true when I purchased back in 2017, and it seems true now. Regardless of distributor, you’re gonna run into what’s called a “panel lottery”. Screens aren’t guaranteed defectless, so it’s basically always a gamble if you’ll receive a panel that has color uniformity problems or dead pixels. My current monitor has a color uniformity problem. Not a huge issue, but when you’re spending so much, it seems ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Monitor buying just sucks. It’s hard to find something that has everything you want. It is what it is.</p>\n<h1>Keyboards</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Filco Majestouch 2, HHKB</h4>\n<p>My main problem is the difficulty in testing out the less common configurations, like the impact of a brass backplate versus a different material. Or rare switches. It’s the main reason I haven’t purchased a new keyboard since 2016.</p>\n<p>Also, I don’t know if I just lucked out buying my keyboards, but I’ve found the uniformity of feeling across keys is actually quite rare to find in keyboards, particularly the modifiers versus the rest of the keys. The Anne Pro 2, for example, although generally reviewed really well, has a massive difference in feeling between the modifiers and alphanumerics.</p>\n<p>With the influx in popularity over mechanical keyboards, accurate information has become harder to find.</p>\n<p>I just want a wireless, nice sounding, uniform feeling keyboard. Wanting wireless makes it particularly difficult, so I don’t know when I’ll get another one.</p>\n<h1>SFFPC (small form factor pc)</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Sliger SM560, vented panels</h4>\n<p>I admit, this was mostly because the form factor looked super cool. It’s not exactly good “value”, unless you value portability and minimalism of your desktop tower.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of options for cases. The important thing is to make sure all your parts will fit, and that the cooling capacity of the case is enough for the parts you want.</p>\n<h1>Wok cooking</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Mamafong round bottom Wok</h4>\n<p>For wok cooking, don’t bother with flat bottoms. I had one for a while, and it’s not the way to go if you want authentic tasting Chinese food (or any other cuisine that utilizes woks). Round bottom woks physically allow a small pool of oil that is essential to making it all work.</p>\n<p>Do whatever it takes. I bought a cast iron wok ring support that lets me use it on any gas burner. I cook outside with a portable gas stove. The results are amazing.</p>\n<h1>Self-hosting</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Odroid HC-1</h4>\n<p>There are a lot of single-board computers out there, but I chose this one because of its form factor and price. Make sure it has the processing power to do the things you want.</p>\n<h1>Personal Logging</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Sheets</h4>\n<p>For me, recording if I did a particular activity that I care to track daily proved to be the best balance of work required to record it, useful insight, and motivation for intentionality.</p>\n<h1>Home Theater</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Klipsch RP-600M, RP-500C, RP-502S, SVS PB-1000, Denon AVR</h4>\n<p>Similar to keyboards, there’s a lack of easy testing and difficulty in ease and availability of purchasing (especially when you need to pair the right speakers together for best results). Klipsch, however, I was able to test in person at Best Buy, and was easily available on Amazon. I’m pretty happy with my setup, but I would have liked to try others. It was rather difficult during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>I recommend trying as many in person as possible, and that the center speaker and subwoofer are the purchases you should spend the most on.</p>\n<h1>Coffee</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Cafelat Robot, J-Max Grinder</h4>\n<p>The grinder is the most important purchase, so make sure you get a good one.</p>\n<p>If you like coffee drinks that don’t utilize espresso, get an Aeropress. Want to have more control or mess around? V60.</p>\n<p>If you want espresso and don’t want to shell out 3-4k, get a hand lever machine. I own and really like the Cafelat Robot. No preheating required, nothing fiddly in the process, and lots of variables to play with. Cheaper automatic espresso machines <em>can</em> make good espresso, but come with issues and maintenance to deal with, and don’t have the options of messing around as the manual lever ones.</p>\n<h1>Synthesizers</h1>\n<h4>Current setup: Launchkey Mini + Ableton Live Lite, OP-1 Field</h4>\n<p><del>A good portable all-in-one machine that you can make full tracks with doesn’t exist. The OP-1 gets really close, but its durability is scary at the price range it sells at. I didn’t want a brick after a year of owning it, so I returned it.</del></p>\n<p><del>I really wish I didn’t have yet another hobby that ties me to a computer but I don’t see a choice. My conclusion on this is to just get a software DAW and a MIDI controller.</del></p>\n<p>You’d be crazy to get an OP-1 Field at its price. The Launchkey Mini and Ableton Live Lite are plenty for making songs, and cost around $100. But the OP-1 workflow is more fun, it’s beautifully designed, and I can have a hobby that doesn’t require me to sit in front of a screen. That’s worth the price for me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Obsessions","date":null,"updated":"Jun 17th, 2021","detached":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/obsessions/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
