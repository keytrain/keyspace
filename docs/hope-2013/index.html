The film is based on a case in South Korea in 2005.</p>
<p>I don’t care for the excess melodrama that usually comes from Korean shows, but this movie avoided all of that. Of course there was crying and howling, of course. The situation is insane. The red teeth marks left on her face is a nightmarish image I won’t forget anytime soon. It warrants it. But they didn’t spend 10 minutes where the characters fall over each other crying their brains out. I appreciated it.</p>
<p>The film’s delivery of scenes reminds me of Hirokazu Kore-eda’s <em>Shoplifters</em> (2018). They’re efficient but powerful, and carefully selected to highlight aspects of the situation that you wouldn’t normally think of. The writing goes beyond the stereotypes and cliches. It’s masterful.</p>
<p>I just couldn’t stop thinking about this film for days after finishing it. I looked into the actual case for more details, but just found more shock with South Korea’s laws. Apparently you can get away with a lot while drunk, and criminal history doesn’t seem to play a part in deciding punishment. The dude only got 12 years after a history of cases, one of which he terrorized an old woman to death!</p>
<p>As of 2020, he’s been released and back to living with his wife <em>in the same town, three streets away from the family</em>. Yes, he actually has a wife that thinks he’s a saint.</p>
<p>What the <em>absolute fuck</em>.</p>
<p>The father said he’d <em>pay</em> the guy to move away.</p>
<p>There were criticisms on the existence of the movie, and for capitalizing on
the incident. I think if they donated a portion of the profit to the family, that’d be ideal, but I believe the movie has a right to exist. If not simply for the reason any art should exist, but because the movie does such a great job at showing how it’s possible to heal from something so horrific and that it’s worth moving on and living.</p>
<p>I did find that the movie forces you to mentally link an eight year old and sex, something that normal people don’t ever do. For a brief period, I saw young girls differently after this movie. It was terrifying.</p></div></div><footer></footer></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/hope-2013/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-e16212ad3700a3c04707.js"],"app":["/app-498a539b6f58418c6836.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-e55336ee4a57a1f28c74.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-3a11612cc9b2dd7c64d7.js"],"component---src-templates-post-js":["/component---src-templates-post-js-4bc962949c7f0c692220.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/keyblog/polyfill-e16212ad3700a3c04707.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/keyblog/component---src-templates-post-js-4bc962949c7f0c692220.js" async=""></script><script src="/keyblog/app-498a539b6f58418c6836.js" async=""></script><script src="/keyblog/framework-8315b003af2b65510d97.js" async=""></script><script src="/keyblog/webpack-runtime-db432b75206bb61584c3.js" async=""></script></body></html>
