Hey Alvin.

We've known each other a long time. I think you're one of my oldest friends. And I think that's pretty special. And it's all because of you. How? I'll tell you.

I wasn't a great friend for a decent period of time. I went through some shit in high school, and it warped my perspective on relationships with people. I pretty much cut everyone off by graduation, and really isolated myself to "start over."

So Alvin, will you be one of my groomsmen? Don't worry, if you can't make it, I'll understand. Let me know! You know how to reach me.

Enjoy the gifts!
