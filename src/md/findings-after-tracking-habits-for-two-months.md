In the past, I've tried tracking my usage of time using [toggl](https://toggl.com), and while it was quite fun to do (_and helped with intentionality_), it ended up being tedious to remember to start and stop timers whenever I did anything. Often I'd find myself starting a timer late into an activity, and then having to fumble about to fix the timing. It's just too much fiddling for something that I think should be mindless.

Some time after that, in an effort to keep myself more accountable to do more of the things I wanted to do, I used a habit tracking app. It was really simple, with a row of squares and a label, where you just tap the square if you had done that particular thing on that day. It was much easier than granular time tracking, and can be done at the end of the day. It let me see how often I did a thing, and I could see patterns, gaps, and rhythms. Problem is, this app was only limited to iOS.

This past February, after a break of using the app, I decided to just make my own version using Numbers on macOS. It's available on any platform, and after an initial investment time, I get to wrangle the data to do whatever I want. It's got dates on the rows, and each goal on the columns. I have a daily and monthly table, and I have a few graphs based on the data such as a line chart tracking the health related habits over the span of the year. There's also a few pie charts that show a certain month's distribution of hobbies. It's been fun.

Although the tracking helps with being intentional about what you're doing and makes it visible when you haven't done a goal in a while, I noticed something different when I looked at the charts today. I felt an appreciation, and perhaps admiration at how often I actually did something. Like an "oh wow, I've actually been pretty good at doing this rather often, despite not really trying". Appreciation and being proud for myself is something I'm absolutely terrible at[^1], so this was a completely unexpected outcome. Very cool.
