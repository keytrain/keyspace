Hey Paul.

Did you know that you're an amazing person? You know that saying about how some people light up rooms? That's you. You have the ability to make a million friends, you've had a million experiences, and you actively live life to the fullest. You inspire me, and I try to learn from you all the time. My hope is that, just by existing alongside you, maybe some of that amazingness will rub off on me.

And all of that is great, but somehow, you are also able to understand me, my life, and my journeys, and I think that's incredibly special. There's nothing that brings me greater joy than when we catch up and I mention some super specific situation or feeling and you just completely get it or vice versa. Whether it's figuring out what our life's work should be, discussing the latest movies, or discovering concepts together, our chats often leave me with a dumb grin on my face.

Our friendship means the world to me, and my life is more colorful with you in it. When it came time to figure out who I could ask to be my groomsmen, you were one of the first I thought of.

So Paul, will you do me the honor of being one of my groomsmen? I'd love to have you up there beside me on that day of reckoning. Don't worry, if you can't make it, I'll understand. Let me know! You know how to reach me.

Enjoy the gifts!
