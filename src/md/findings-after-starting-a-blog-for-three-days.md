I initially made the blog to have a place to archive thoughts that live and die in my head, but for the past couple of days, I've realized... how much fun I'm having... like a child discovering the joys of penning about their crush.[^1]

Getting the words to look all pretty and _typographic_ is great, and seeing your words get that treatment on screen when you hit save is addictive. Having a dedicated space to express myself is also comforting. The feelings are probably no stranger to anyone who writes or blogs regularly. There's also a kind of cool feeling that the only form of expression is the words and nothing else. I've come full circle. I'm now finally old enough to appreciate the art of... writing in your diary.

It's not without its problems. When I try to write, I stumble because I can't think and focus on one thread at a time. I want to say the ten things I have to say about it, right now, organized paragraphs be damned. I'll need to come up with some kind of process. Maybe bullet points and outlining.

I also can't seem to edit without breaking flow or rhythm. I've spent quite some time editing the previous posts, and I think I just need to lay it to bed. This has been a known problem for me, so hopefully I can solve it by continuing to write.

But beyond the literacy gains, my overall goal is to record the mind and its evolution. When I'm 50, I want to go back and see what I thought about cereal when I was 29. Then 37. By 42, cereal is the Man trying to gain influence with my kids, so we're a no cereal household.
