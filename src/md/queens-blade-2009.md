This is a review from a brief period of time when I wrote anime reviews on tumblr for all of three days. I still like it.

The story is simple. Leina leaves the nest and partakes in the Queen's Blade as a means to find herself. Along the way, she gains perspective from the various people she meets. The Queen's Blade--I'll be using QB for short--is a free-form tournament that can take place anywhere by initiating battle, and works as the engine to push the story where it needs to go. It's a solid setting for character development, which comprises most of the show.

Almost all the episodes serve as character introductions. By the end of any episode, you're guaranteed to know the spotlighted character's motivations for winning QB. This story structure could feel repetitive or bland, but the show has a nice variety in its characters, their motivations, and the respective settings to keep it fresh. The problem is how it all plays out.

A fair portion of each episode is spent on the battle between the relevant characters, however, character strengths and powers have no rationale behind them, nor do the battles contain any semblance of strategy. Characters win because one is simply "stronger" than the other. Leina's arc as a whole focuses on strength, mentally and physically, but since both facets are so lazily assembled in QB's world, her developments are felt with very little impact.

Lazy storytelling litters every episode and gets worse as it goes on. Exposition is almost never inferred, but directly told, often repeated ad nauseam. The writing starves the characters from being more than their surface personalities, which makes their interactions between each other lacking in depth. The colorful cast sometimes leads to some interesting banter, but only glimpses of real presence can be found in any scene. It's a shame.

QB's claim to fame was its excessive nudity, which is in itself a product of its time. It was widely panned at release, and it's what got me curious to eventually check it out. What I found was that the characters take the nudity in stride, which lends an air of maturity most shows cut from the same cloth don't have. The lack of male characters tremendously helps. Erotic scenarios also have the convenient excuse of simply being extensions of character personalities.

More or less, QB's world allows it all to blend in and "work". I thought that was fairly unique, and made the show more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been.
