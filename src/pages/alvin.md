Hey Alvin.

Hope you're doing well.

We've known each other a long time, and at this point, you're one of my oldest friends. I think that's pretty special, and you're the one that had the ability to keep it going. I'm glad you did.

See, I wasn't a great friend of yours for a decent period of time. I went through some shit in high school, and it warped my perspective on relationships with people. I pretty much cut everyone off by graduation, and really isolated myself to "start over."

You, however, never failed to leave birthday wishes, or send a text every once in a while. You managed to stay a persistent presence. That's powerful. I didn't really understand how powerful it was until I met Danielle, as she is also able to keep a lot of friends. Meanwhile, I've got friends I can count on maybe two hands. That's fine. I reap what I sow. I'm working on it.

You inspire me with your hard work and persistence. Thanks for being my friend all these years. Thanks for just being there, and being a stable presence. Everyone needs someone like you in their lives.

However, I do have one thing to ask of you.

Alvin, will you be one of my groomsmen? Haha.

Our wedding's on May 20th, 2023 in Long Beach, CA.

Don't worry, if you can't make it, I understand. Let me know! You know how to reach me.

Enjoy the gifts!
