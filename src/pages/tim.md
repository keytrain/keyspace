Yo.

You said I didn't need to write a letter, but I know you'd enjoy one anyway. It's true there's not much that I haven't said to you about our friendship, but it bears repeating.

You and I are bound by the traumatic experience that was high school, like brothers in arms. You helped me get through that tough period of time, with great distractions of porn and scanlation. You were there to always talk about anything and everything, whatever came to my mind, and vice versa.

And then you helped me get my first legit job, to get my career started. Your influence to start a scan group directly led to me finding a girlfriend, and now fianc√©.

I owe like, 80% of my current life to you. You'll say "nah, you did all the work" and sure that's true, but the first step is just as important. I will forever be indebted.

Even though we decided we'd be each other's best men at our weddings probably during that summer after high school graduation, I don't know what kind of person would hold the title "best man" better. You're like the best man of best mans. Pretty sure if there was some metric of top best man's, the only people that'd score higher are those that saved lives.

Anyway, I hope we'll continue to figure out life together until we're playing Fromsoft's latest game when we're 80. I hope more good things come your way, and if there's anything I can do, just ask. I know you're absolute shit at helping yourself, so be selfish a little bit more. Maybe I just need to do things for you without you asking.

Enjoy the gifts, and praise the sun.
