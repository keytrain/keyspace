Hey Paul.

Hope you're doing well.

I don't know if you noticed, but I'm a Paul fanboy. You're the kind of person that light up rooms. You have the ability to make a million friends. You've got a chest of a million experiences. You actively live life to the fullest. You live the life I strive to live. You're doing it right. You inspire me, and I try to learn from you all the time. I hope that, just by being tangentially involved in your life, maybe some of that amazingness will rub off on me.

And all of that is great, but somehow, you're also able to understand me, my life, my thoughts, and in my experience, I know something like that is pretty special. There's nothing that brings me greater joy than when I mention some super specific situation or feeling and you just completely get it or vice versa. Whether it's figuring out what our life's work should be, discussing the latest movies, or discovering concepts together, our chats often leave me with a dumb grin on my face.

So when it came time to figure out who I could ask to be my groomsmen, you were one of the first I thought of.

Paul, will you do me the honor of being one of my groomsmen?

Our wedding's on May 20th, 2023 in Long Beach, CA.

Don't worry, if you can't make it, I understand. Let me know! You know how to reach me.

Enjoy the gifts!
