Hey John.

Hope you're doing well.

I might have told you this already, but high school was pretty terrible for me. Traumatizing. I developed an extremely cynical attitude towards relationships with people of any kind. When I met you, for the the first year of knowing you, I was always prepared for the eventuality that you'd do something shitty.

But you never did. You were like the first person I met in a long while that was just wholesome? All around? Crazy concept, I know. Somehow, all my relationships in high school were toxic in some way, but because of you, I was able to begin healing some of that trauma from high school. I'm not sure where I'd be if we never met, but it's possible I may not have any of the relationships I have now, including the girl I'm about to marry.

Of course, I also have so many great memories from our time in college.

The long hours of discussing the randomest shit in the ERC cafeteria, to drunken smash bros, to that one time we came back from a movie and thought the road was too cinematic. Juggling seven threads of convos at once, diving deep into topics, sharing new approaches to life and trying them out together and giving feedback. Listening to Taylor Swift, freezing Nima's boxers, cramming for biology till 5am. You blaring "Stephen".

I don't think I'll forget any of those memories.

The combination of these things has made you into an important person in my life, and the more time has passed, the more obvious it becomes. So when it came time to think about groomsmen, there's nobody else who'd make more sense to me.

So John, will you be one of my groomsmen?

Our wedding's on May 20th, 2023 in Long Beach, CA.

I know you've got a busy life, so if you can't make it, I'll understand. Let me know. You know how to reach me.

Enjoy the gifts! We should catch up more often.
